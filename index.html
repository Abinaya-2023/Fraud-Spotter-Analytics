        <h1 align="center">Fraud Spotter Analytics</h1>
       
        <h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2>
       
        <p>Fraud Spotter Analytics is a comprehensive data analytics project which aims to identify, analyze and discover the patterns in fraudulent insurance claims made by policyholders. Insurance fraud is a growing concern causing loss of billions of dollars to the industry annually. With the increase in false insurance claims the insurance companies are in the need to use data analytics to mitigate the false claim. This project combines cutting-edge Exploratory Data Analytics using Python, a detailed SQL case study and insightful data visualizations using Power BI to uncover the patterns.</p>
        <h2>APPLICATIONS:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Real time fraud detection and mitigation: </strong>With the use of the insights and patterns detected in the project we can analyze for similar patterns in real time and detect fraud claims.</li>
            <li><strong>Streamlining claims processing: </strong>By automating the detection of suspicious claims, the project will help streamlining the process workflow.</li>
            <li><strong>Resource allocation: </strong>With the patterns know insurers can allocate funds to investigate on the claims efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Customer trust: </strong>Enhancing the trust and satisfaction among honest customers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CENTRAL REVELATIONS:</h2>
        <h2>CLAIMS</h2>
        
        <center><img src="Insurance Dashboard/A.jpg"></center>
      
        <ul>
            <li>Most of the insurance claims were made by male policy holders and most of the incidents have happened in urban areas shows that male drivers may drive more frequently and tend to have riskier driving behaviors and cover long distances than females, increase the likelihood of accidents and claims.</li>
            <li>39.03% of claims made under collision base policy shows that distracted driving, speeding, or aggressive driving are most likely the factors behind these claims.</li>
            <li>39.66% of total claims were made on the year 1994.</li>
        </ul>
   
        <h3>Preventive measures:</h3>
    
        <p>Since most number of accidents happen in urban areas there is a need to allocate more funds to investigate the accidents happens in urban areas and implements more rigorous claim processes involving male drivers to identify potential fraudulent claims.</p>
       
        <center><img src = "Insurance Dashboard/B.jpg"></center>

        <ul>
            <li>62.98% of claims were made on the vehicle category sedan because sedans are commonly used for daily commuting. Traffic congestion and complex driving behaviors increases the chances of accidents.</li>
            <li>In 72.53% of the claims the accident or fault is caused by the policy holder. This happens because of poor maintenance, new drivers, driving under the influence of alcohol and distracted driving.</li>
            <li>70.36% of claims were made by the policy holders whose marital status is married. Married policy holders filed more claims because of high population distribution, family vehicles tend to be used by multiple people with various stages of skills and driving behaviors, regular routine of travel causes more wear and tear.</li>
            <li>Most of the claims seems to happen in the month of January and may. Cold weather on January can affect vehicle performance and conditions like smog and fog causes reduced visibility of roads Delhi leading to accidents.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Preventive measures:</h3>
 
        <ol>
            <li>Since sedan vehicles are more likely to involved in collisions and have higher repair cost we can consider higher premiums. </li>
            <li>Introducing usage-based insurance programs using telematics to monitor the driving behavior of drivers can benefit the insurers to process claims. </li>
            <li>Rewarding the safe driving with lower premiums and provide feedback to drivers on how to improve their driving habits can help us to reduce false claims.</li>

        </ol>
  
        <center><img src="Insurance Dashboard/C.jpg"></center>
       
        <ul>
            <li>98.85% of claims are filed after 30 days of the policy started.</li>
            <li>24.37% of claims were filed on Monday shows that the accidents happened on weekend’s are often reported on Monday and there is a high potential for accidents to occur because of heavy traffic caused when people commute from place to place after weekend.</li>
            <li>0.33% of claims were filed on Sunday because of less traffic.</li>
            <li>53.5% of claims were made on vehicles which cost from 20K to 29K because of its common presence in the market and these vehicles are used for daily commute.</li>
        </ul>
   
        <h3>Preventive measures:</h3>
     
        <ol>
            <li>Increase staffs and resources on Monday to handle higher volume of claims.</li>
            <li>Tailor risk assessment models to account for the higher claim rate for vehicles in the $20K to $29K range and adjust premiums and coverage options accordingly.</li>
            <li>Encourage policyholders to perform regular vehicle maintenance to prevent accidents and faults.</li>
        </ol>
      
        <center><img src="Insurance Dashboard/D.jpg"></center>
    
        <ul>
            <li>38.47% of claims were made on vehicle of age 7. It shows that the owner of these vehicles might neglect the regular maintenance which increases the risk of breakdown and accidents causes more number of claims.</li>
            <li>37.01% of claims were by policyholders of age between 31 and 35. Policyholders aged 31 to 35 are often in a busy life, juggling careers, family responsibilities, and possibly financial pressures. This life stage contributes to increased stress and potentially riskier behavior, causes higher number of claims.</li>
        </ul>
       
        <h3>Preventive measures:</h3>
       
        <ol>
            <li>Implement more thorough investigations on claims involving older vehicles to identify the underlying cause of the issue.</li>
            <li>Educate the policyholder to maintain the record of regular vehicle maintenance which can be reviewed while processing the claims.</li>
            <li>Offer free or discounted vehicle inspections for vehicle over age 5 to identify and address potential issues.</li>
        </ol>
       
        <h2>FRADULENT CLAIMS</h2>
       
        <center><img src="Insurance Dashboard/E.jpg"></center>
   
        <ul>
            <li>5.91% of total claims were found to be false claims. This can occur because of various reasons such as trying to acquire financial benefits dishonestly and misunderstanding of policy terms.</li>
            <li>Policyholders belong to the age group of 31-35 have filed 45% of fraud claims. Individuals belong to this age range may have greater exposure to situations where insurance claims could be manipulated, financial pressures or perception of lower risk of detection.</li>
            <li>May month has the highest number of fraud claims filed because it coincide with seasonal factors and vacation times cause more outdoor activities and potential accidents. </li>
            <li>7.04% of claims made on the month of May are found to be fraud claims.</li>
            <li>43.4% of fraud claims are filed associated with the policy type sedan-all perils. Sedan-all perils policy type might cover a broad range of incidents, making it easier for fraudsters to file claims for damages that are harder to verify.</li>
        </ul>
       
        <h3>Preventive measures:</h3>
       
        <ol>
            <li>Additional thorough documentation checks and claim investigations has to be implemented on the policyholders of age group 31-35 to verify the authenticity of the reported incident.</li>
            <li>Allocating additional resources to claim verification and investigation processes during peak claim months can help mitigating the fraudulent activity.</li>
            <li>Requesting additional evidence or conducting independent assessments to validate the extent of reported damages or losses for policy types known to have higher fraudulent activities.</li>

        </ol>
       
        <center><img src="Insurance Dashboard/F.jpg"></center>
      
        <ul>
            <li>99.55% of fraud claims were made by policyholders who have external agents. The high percentage of fraud claims made by policyholders who have external agents could indicate a potential issue with agent integrity to earn commissions.</li>
            <li>97.21% of total claims have no police report filed and 5.82% of those claims are found to be fraud. The lack of police reports indicate there might be lack of awareness about the importance of filing reports.</li>
            <li>Only 2.78% of total claims have police report filed and 5% of those police report filed claims are found to be fraudulent claims.</li>
            <li>98.28% of false claims made after 30 days of policy start have no police report filed and the other duration fraud claims also have no police report filed on the incidents.</li>
            <li>Only 1.71% of false claims have police report filed.</li>
            <li>99.55% of fraud claims have no witness present suggests that the incidents are intentionally done by the fraudsters and without evidence they are least likely to be reported as false claims.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Preventive measures:</h3>
       
        <ol>
            <li>Insurance companies with external agents must implement strict rules and accountability measures for agents and conduct regular audits of agent activities.</li>
            <li>Educate the policyholders to file police reports when incidents occur.</li>
            <li>Encourage the policyholders to seek out witnesses in the event of an incident.</li>
            <li>Claims without police reports and witnesses must be scrutinized completely.</li>
        </ol>
      
        <center><img src="Insurance Dashboard/G.jpg"></center>
       
        <ul>
            <li>5.59% of total claims on 7 year old vehicle are found to be fraudulent claims. This may happen because the older vehicles will already have enough wear and tear which can be exaggerated.</li>
            <li>35.76% of fraud claims done by policyholders have no other past claims. This shows that the policyholders may be intentionally exploiting their clean claims history to avoid suspicion.</li>
            <li>36.43% of fraudulent claims are made on vehicle of age 7.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Preventive measures:</h3>
       
        <ol>
            <li>Offer discounts or free inspections for vehicle older than 5 years to have a record of potential issues.</li>
            <li>Request the policy holder to maintain regular vehicle maintenance record and documentation which supports their claim to promote transparency.</li>
            <li>Conducting regular claims audits and policyholder profiles to detect for anomalies and unusual claim patterns can help mitigate fraudulent claims.</li>

        </ol>
       
        <center><img src="Insurance Dashboard/H.jpg"></center>
        
        <ul>
            <li>95.85% of fraud claims were made by policyholders who made the fault themselves. The high percentage of fraud claims made by policyholders who admit fault themselves suggests a willingness to exploit their insurance coverage for personal gain.</li>
            <li>88.56% of fraud claims were made by male. This might be because of the risk-taking behaviors of the individuals.</li>
            <li>98.09% of fraud claims has no police report and witness present. The majority of fraud claims lacking police reports and witness suggests a deliberate effort by fraudsters to minimize external scrutiny and verification of their claims.</li>
            <li>47.19% of fraud claims were made on vehicles whose price ranges are between 20000 and 29000. These might be perceived lower risk of detection due to the vehicle's value.</li>
        </ul>
       
        <h3>Preventive measures:</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Implement comprehensive investigations on the policyholder’s statements on the fault and causation of the incident.</li>
            <li>Implement mandatory reporting requirements for all the claimants to file police reports and to provide witness statements for incidents.</li>
            <li>Enhance claims verification procedures for vehicles within the identified price range and conduct more rigorous inspections.</li>

        </ol>
       
        <h2>PATTERNS IDENTIFIED:</h2>
      
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Age Group of Policyholders: </strong>Policyholders belong to the age group 31 to 35 are responsible for filing 45% of fraud claims.</li>
            <li><strong>Month of Claim Submission: </strong>May has the highest number of fraud claims filed which coincides with seasonal factors and vacation times leading to increased outdoor activities and potential accidents.</li>
            <li><strong>Policy Type: </strong>43.4% of fraud claims are associated with the policy type "sedan-all perils." This policy type covers a broad range of incidents potentially making it easier for fraudsters to fabricate claims for damages that are harder to verify.</li>
            <li><strong>Use of External Agents: </strong>99.55% of fraud claims were made by policyholders who have external agents. This high percentage raises doubts about agent integrity and the potential for agents to facilitate fraudulent claims for their own financial gain.</li>
            <li><strong>Delayed Reporting: </strong>98.85% of fraud claims are filed after 30 days of the policy start. Delayed reporting may allow fraudsters to manipulate claims.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of Police Reports and Witnesses: </strong>98.09% of fraud claims have no police report and witness present. This absence of proper documentation suggests a deliberate effort by fraudsters to avoid external scrutiny and verification of their claims.</li>
            <li><strong>Vehicle Price Range: </strong>47.19% of fraud claims were made on vehicles in the price range of $20,000 to $29,000. Fraudsters may perceive lower risk of detection due to the vehicle's value making it an easy target for false claims.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h2>CONCLUSION:</h2>
      
        <p>Based on these findings, it is evident that mitigating insurance fraud requires a multi-dimensional approach involving enhanced fraud detection protocols, closer collaboration between insurers and law enforcement agencies, and targeted intermediaries to address specific risk factors. By implementing the proactive measures insurers can safeguard the integrity of the insurance system, protect the interests of honest policyholders, and mitigate financial losses associated with false claims.</p>
